## English README

An online file browser framework with the frontend using native JS DOM functions and the backend built on Python's Flask framework.

Both Windows and Linux systems are supported. It features a lightweight and minimalist design, is easy to deploy, and has a decent-looking UI.

It features a separation of frontend and backend, with functionalities including file browsing, downloading, uploading, and deleting.

There is no authentication. It is intended for learning purposes only and is not suitable for public deployment.

It was developed on a whim, so the code is rather messy.

Some parts of the code were generated by AI.
